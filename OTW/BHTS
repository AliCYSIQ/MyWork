level9: Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one 
of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

the command i use to solve it is : cat data.txt |strings|grep ===*
why ? cat extract the text then strings show only the readable text
and grep = , we know that from the goal of the level 
"preceded by several ‘=’ characters."

level10: Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, 
which contains base64 encoded data

the command i use is cat data.txt | base64 -d 
Base64 is an encoding scheme used to represent binary data 
(like images, files, or any non-text data) in an ASCII text format.
It’s not encryption — just a way to encode data for safe transmission.

   Converts binary → text (printable characters: A–Z, a–z, 0–9, +, /)

    Often used in:

        Email attachments (MIME)

        Embedding images in HTML/CSS

        API tokens or basic HTTP auth

        Obfuscation in CTFs or malware
so to convert something to it use base64 and to enccode use -d 
and be base64 -d

level11:Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt,
where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been 
rotated by 13 positions

first it useing ROT13 , what is ROT13? ROT13 is a simple substitution 
cipher that replaces each letter with the letter 13 positions later 
in the alphabet (looping around if needed). It affects A–Z and a–z, 
but not numbers or symbols.

the command i use is cat data.txt | tr "A-Za-z" "N-ZA-Mn-za-m"
tr is command that translait or delete and it work
